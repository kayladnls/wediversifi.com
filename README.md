#The spark

Kayla ([@kayladns](http://www.twitter.com/kayladnls)) and I ([@gabidavila](http://www.twitter.com/kayladnls)) were in [LaraconEU](http://laracon.eu) 2014 talking to [Matt Stauffer](http://www.twitter.com/stauffermatt), and it was a conversation post a [diversity presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/gabidavila/coding-like-a-girl?qid=7e7ce085-0fb4-4cfe-97f3-118f6489b311&v=default&b=&from_search=1), and Matt said that the he was facing some difficulties regarding contacting the minority/diversity groups, because they don't answer to his emails.

So when he has a job opening, he tries to advertise to those kinds of groups, but as he receives no feedback, it was hard even getting non-white males to submit to his job posting. He asked us if we had any idea on how to help him through our contacts to send to him people we know of, like women, people of color, and from other ethinicity.

#The idea

So this is when this idea come in place. We want to create a portal for companies and potential candidates, where companies commit to try to increase their diversity rate, and there they create a profile with their vision of diversity and with their Linkedin job feeds, or another tool like that.

#Why?

That way we would have a centralized portal with companies, and we all know that Facebook, Google and other big companies have diversity hiring programs, but they don't know if company A or B are diversity friendly.

#How?


* Company profiles
* User profiles


* Companies sign up and pledge support for diversity. 
* We pull in a feed of job posting for that company. 
* Applicants apply to job posting. 
* If a company hires based on applicants recieved through us, they gain points and are scored. 
* Companies get a badge for their effort

#What do we need?

Help of the community, this is project that will be done in our free time, so we need designers, frontend, backend, basically anyone who can help us!
